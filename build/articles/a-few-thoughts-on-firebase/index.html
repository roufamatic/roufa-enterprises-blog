<hr>
<p>I&#39;m building a JavaScript version of the old “dots and lines” game, just for fun. Players take turns choosing line segments on a grid of dots, and when one completes a box (four line segments) he/she gets a point and another&nbsp;turn. </p>
<p>My original plan was to try to build this with Firebase. Right off the bat, FireBase packages up much of what I want from my game&#39;s backend: a place to store moves, real-time updates when moves happen, and the ability to distinguish between users via&nbsp;authorization.</p>
<p>I hit my first snag when I started to think about security. In a traditional client/server game model, the server maintains a representation of the entire game and acts as the authority on whether any given move is legal. If somebody attempts to cheat by playing a move out of turn, the server can easily detect and prevent&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Firebase, on the other hand, was designed as a promiscuous database in the cloud. Secrecy in Firebase is managed by writing “security rules” in the “Forge” (their dashboard). In their security model, you must pre-define what areas of your data tree are available to each user. Considering that its main selling point is persisting arbitrary <span class="caps">JSON</span> objects, having to spend time on their server defining security rules has a definite “bolted-on”&nbsp;feel.</p>
<p>Validation on their platform requires a lot of planning ahead. In my case, I first tried to tackle the idea of each player having to take turns. There are a few ways to do this in Firebase, but the easiest is to disallow a write to a particular node if the last write was by the same user. Simple&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Then came the case where completing a box would give the current user another turn. At this point, Firebase lost its appeal. The solution is to give Firebase a representation of the entire game, just as I&#39;d want in a server-side solution. But… how? How complicated would the validation logic&nbsp;be? </p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying there is no solution to the problem that would use Firebase exclusively. There may well be. What I am saying is that, within a few hours, I realized that any solution would be an order of magnitude more difficult than having my own server perform the same task. And at that point… why not host my own&nbsp;database?</p>

Hi, I&#39;m Michael Roufa.</p>
<p>For the last 15 years, I‘ve been working with talented designers and UX experts to bring their ideas to life using whatever technologies are at hand. I specialize in backend development and build/deploy automation, but I’m no JavaScript slouch either. I hold a Masters in Software Engineering from Seattle University.</p>
