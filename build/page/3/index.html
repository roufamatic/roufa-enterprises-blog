<p>My laptop returned with one bad <span class="caps">RAM</span> stick missing. While it was gone, I discovered I prefer Windows 8.1 to its predecessor, especially the return of the start button and the improved start screen that installers cannot automatically colonize. I upgraded my laptop&nbsp;immediately.</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced more changes under the hood, though, and a few programs stopped working. One was <a href="http://www.1upindustries.com/Bins/default.aspx">Bins</a> which I use to keep my browsers together, but they had a <a href="http://feedback.1upindustries.com/forums/103687-bugs/suggestions/4681319-windows-8-1-werfault-exe-error-upon-starting-bins">fix available</a>.</p>
<p>A more serious problem was the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/general-support/33644-upgrade-8-1-disaster.html">Juniper Remote Desktop Client</a>. Without this, I was unable to complete my latest&nbsp;contract.</p>
<p>I saw two viable&nbsp;options: </p>
<ol>
<li>Rollback (noooo! not my new shiny&nbsp;toy!)</li>
<li><span class="caps">VM</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, #2 won. But I couldn&#39;t locate my Windows 8 installation disks, and was not about to fork over more cash just to run one program. The solution? <a href="http://modern.ie/">modern.<span class="caps">IE</span></a>! I grabbed a copy of <span class="caps">XP</span> with IE8, threw it into Hyper-V, and I&#39;m back in&nbsp;business. </p>
<p>While it‘s intended to ease the pain of backwards-compatible web development, modern.<span class="caps">IE</span> is also a great resource for emergency backwards-compatible Windows development. Somebody reports a Vista bug? Grab a Vista image and test. Need to check something on Windows Server 2012? That’s there as well. The images have a 30 day grace period after which you need to purchase a license, so you cannot use the same OS indefinitely. But still, it&#39;s a very useful addition to my&nbsp;toolkit.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Thought I‘d leave this nugget in case it helps somebody. Yesterday my 6-month-old Lenovo ThinkPad W530 died, and my wife needed a new computer anyway, so I picked up a Mac Mini. It’s her computer, but will act as my emergency machine in case something like this happens again. Since I&#39;m primarily a Windows developer, I set up a small partition with Boot&nbsp;Camp.</p>
<p>Here‘s what I’ve learned: If you&#39;re attempting to install Windows 8.1 on a Mac Mini using Boot Camp, and you choose to download the drivers to a <span class="caps">USB</span> flash drive and then install from an external DVD drive, <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4536">you must remove the flash drive before rebooting into the Windows installer</a>. Otherwise you‘ll just see a blank screen and nothing will happen and you’ll be scared and afraid for your brand new&nbsp;purchase.</p>
<p>Also, the “alt” key is your friend if you don&#39;t have an Apple keyboard — hold it down on boot to see the boot&nbsp;options.</p>

<p>During the presentation I tried to demonstrate <span class="caps">TDD</span> by building <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">FizzBuzz</a> in a test-driven manner, then showed off Dependency Injection and Mocking by adding text from my twitter&nbsp;feed. </p>

<p>Notes: </p>
<ol>
<li>I removed my twitter app authentication keys, so if you execute the program it won&#39;t work. See the file Twit.cs and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs">Twitter Development</a> if you feel the need to resuscitate&nbsp;this.</li>
<li>I turned off the Azure <span class="caps">VM</span> that hosted the Jenkins instance referenced in the slides. It was costing me two cents an hour! That&#39;s like a latte every&nbsp;week.</li>

Hi, I&#39;m Michael Roufa.</p>
<p>For the last 15 years, I‘ve been working with talented designers and UX experts to bring their ideas to life using whatever technologies are at hand. I specialize in backend development and build/deploy automation, but I’m no JavaScript slouch either. I hold a Masters in Software Engineering from Seattle University.</p>
