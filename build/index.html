          <section class="content"><p><img src="/articles/nhibernate-cant-short-circuit/JohnnyFive.jpg" alt="Johnny Five Is Alive"></p>
<p><a href="http://nhforge.org/">NHibernate</a> has a <span class="caps">LINQ</span> provider that allows you to query your tables, saving you the trouble of having to learn HQL or Criteria to get data out of your&nbsp;database. </p>
<p>While doing some refactoring on an NHibernate-driven site, I came across a nasty&nbsp;exception:</p>
<pre><code>System.ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null. Parameter name: source 
at System.Linq.Enumerable.Cast[TResult](IEnumerable source)</code></pre>
<p>This was a bit confusing at first. The code was already checking for null&#39;s. What&nbsp;gives?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">List&lt;<span class="keyword">int</span>&gt; list = <span class="keyword">null</span>;
<span class="comment">// ... something tries to populate the list ...</span>
<span class="comment">// If there's anything in the list, use that as a filter. </span>
<span class="comment">// Otherwise return everything.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> q = Session.Query&lt;Tbl&gt;()
               .Where(t =&gt; list == <span class="keyword">null</span> || list.Contains(t.IntProp));</code></pre>
<p>Looking at the error message and the debugger it became clear that even though there the <code>list</code> variable was being evaluated. That&#39;s very unusual behavior in C# as the <code>||</code> operator is supposed to “short-circuit:” when the first operand evaluates to <code>true</code>, the second is not evaluated at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the parameter of the <code>Where</code> clause is not really C#. It is, in fact, an Expression. NHibernate does not execute this expression directly. Instead, it uses it to generate <span class="caps">SQL</span> to run against the&nbsp;database. </p>
<p>To illustrate, suppose that there were no null check, and the list contained the values [1,2,3]. It might try to do something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sql"><span class="operator"><span class="keyword"><span class="caps">SELECT</span></span> * <span class="keyword"><span class="caps">FROM</span></span> Tbl <span class="keyword"><span class="caps">WHERE</span></span> IntProp <span class="keyword"><span class="caps">IN</span></span> (<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">3</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Now let‘s assume the list is null, but there’s still no null-check in the expression. It would attempt to convert the list to its <span class="caps">SQL</span> equivalent and fail with the same exception as&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>Finally, we add the null check. Now NHibernate still is trying to generate a query. Perhaps it decides that “list <span class="caps">IS</span> NULL” is a perfectly reasonable SQL expression, or perhaps not. Regardless, <em>it still has to iterate over the list to generate the <code>IN</code> clause</em>, which it cannot&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>In essence, we are mixing a test that doesn‘t belong in a query with a test that does, but NHibernate simply cannot easily know that’s the case. The solution is to move the tests where they&nbsp;belong.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">List&lt;<span class="keyword">int</span>&gt; list = <span class="keyword">null</span>;
<span class="comment">// ... something tries to populate the list ...</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> q = Session.Query&lt;Tbl&gt;();
<span class="comment">// If there's anything in the list, use that as a filter. </span>
<span class="comment">// Otherwise return everything.</span>
<span class="keyword">if</span> (list != <span class="keyword">null</span>) {
    q = q.Where(t =&gt; list.Contains(t.IntProp));
}</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s a bit clumsier without the fluent interface to lean on, but it does have the side benefit of making the resultant <span class="caps">SQL</span> query&nbsp;cleaner.</p>

<p>My laptop returned with one bad <span class="caps">RAM</span> stick missing. While it was gone, I discovered I prefer Windows 8.1 to its predecessor, especially the return of the start button and the improved start screen that installers cannot automatically colonize. I upgraded my laptop&nbsp;immediately.</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced more changes under the hood, though, and a few programs stopped working. One was <a href="http://www.1upindustries.com/Bins/default.aspx">Bins</a> which I use to keep my browsers together, but they had a <a href="http://feedback.1upindustries.com/forums/103687-bugs/suggestions/4681319-windows-8-1-werfault-exe-error-upon-starting-bins">fix available</a>.</p>
<p>A more serious problem was the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/general-support/33644-upgrade-8-1-disaster.html">Juniper Remote Desktop Client</a>. Without this, I was unable to complete my latest&nbsp;contract.</p>
<p>I saw two viable&nbsp;options: </p>
<ol>
<li>Rollback (noooo! not my new shiny&nbsp;toy!)</li>
<li><span class="caps">VM</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, #2 won. But I couldn&#39;t locate my Windows 8 installation disks, and was not about to fork over more cash just to run one program. The solution? <a href="http://modern.ie/">modern.<span class="caps">IE</span></a>! I grabbed a copy of <span class="caps">XP</span> with IE8, threw it into Hyper-V, and I&#39;m back in&nbsp;business. </p>
<p>While it‘s intended to ease the pain of backwards-compatible web development, modern.<span class="caps">IE</span> is also a great resource for emergency backwards-compatible Windows development. Somebody reports a Vista bug? Grab a Vista image and test. Need to check something on Windows Server 2012? That’s there as well. The images have a 30 day grace period after which you need to purchase a license, so you cannot use the same OS indefinitely. But still, it&#39;s a very useful addition to my&nbsp;toolkit.</p>
