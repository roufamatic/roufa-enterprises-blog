After a very short period running [Orchard](http://www.orchardproject.net/) for my blog, I decided to reverse course and try out [wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io) instead. 

Orchard seemed like a natural fit for me when I started out. Open source, free, .NET-based, and installed with one click from Azure's dashboard. I figured I'd spend some time with it, tweak it a bit, make it my own... But then, I didn't. I had zero desire to play with it. For my needs, it was far too heavyweight, like peeling a potato with a sword.

Enter wintersmith. It's a node.js variant of Jekyll. Posts are composed as markdown files in a folder structure, with Jade templates to determine the layout. And right out of the box, it looks nice. Editing .md files with the [Web Essentials extension](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ed4c78f-a23e-49ad-b5fd-369af0c2107f) to Visual Studio is a joy as you can see what the changes will look like every time you press save.

The blog is hosted on Azure following [these steps](http://www.collectivematters.com/2012/12/getting-your-blog-onto-azure/). My blog is now code on github. I like it.
